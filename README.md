# Currency Converter

This is a simple currency converter application built with React. It allows you to convert between different currencies using real-time exchange rates.

## How it Works

The application fetches the latest exchange rates from a free API and uses them to perform the currency conversions. You can select the base currency and the target currency, and the application will instantly show you the converted amount.

## Technologies Used

*   **Font Awesome:** A popular icon set and toolkit.
